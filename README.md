# GeospatialAnalysis
Geospatial analysis using ArcGIS and QGIS for two different studies. One a fire department emergency response time analysis, and the other a property value study on the impact of nearby business. The results of the fire department study led to city council proposing a new staffing model to their residents. I anticipate the property value study to be published in early 2019.
